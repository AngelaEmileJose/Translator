# 🇰🇷 K-Context Translator

**Understand the *nuance* behind the Korean.**

K-Context is not just a translator; it's a cultural interpreter designed specifically for international students and travelers in Korea. Unlike standard translation apps that give you literal meanings, K-Context provides the "hidden" context—politeness levels, safety scores, and practical foreigner-friendly tips.

## ✨ Why K-Context?

Standard translators (like Google Translate or Papago) are great for literal text, but they often miss the cultural context that is critical in Korea.

| Feature | Standard Translators | ✅ K-Context Translator |
|---------|---------------------|------------------------|
| **Format** | Literal translation | **Cultural & Natural translation** |
| **Politeness** | Often gets it wrong | **Identifies Banmal vs. Jondetmal** |
| **Safety** | No safety warnings | **Safety Score (1-10) & Alerts** |
| **Menu/Signs** | Just translates text | **Explains ingredients & rules** |
| **Context** | None | **"Foreigner Context" Tips** |

## 🚀 Key Features

- **Text & Camera Translation**: Type or snap a photo of menus, signs, or documents.
- **Context Clues**: Explains *why* something is said that way (e.g., "This is a popular hangover cure").

- **Word Breakdown**: Learn the language while you translate with detailed word-by-word analysis.
